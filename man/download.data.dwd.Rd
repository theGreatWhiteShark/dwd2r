\usage{
download.data.dwd(save.downloads = TRUE, csv.export = FALSE,
  url = NULL, data.type = c("default", "temp.max", "temp.min", "prec",
  "temp.mean", "vapor.pressure", "cloud.amount", "air.pressure",
  "relative.humidity", "wind.speed", "temp.min.at.ground",

  "snow.height"), download.folder = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{save.downloads}{If TRUE the downloaded .zip files are stored
in download.folder/downloads_dwd. Else they will be deleted after
the extracting. Default = TRUE.}

\item{csv.export}{If TRUE creates an additional folder containing
.csv files with the individual station data. Using this the data
can be used outside of R too. Default = FALSE.}

\item{url}{If the user wants to avoid the guided selection.}

\item{data.type}{Specifies which kind of information from the
downloaded files should be extracted. This input can be a
character vector  The options are: temp.max, temp.min, prec,
default (for both the daily maximum and minimum temperature and
the precipitation), temp.mean, vapor.pressure, cloud.amount,
air.pressure, quality (-999 = faulty or suspicious, 1 =
superficially checked, 2 = checked according to individual
criterion, 3 = old automated check and correction, 5 =
historical and subjective check, 7 = additional second check but
without correction, 8 = quality check outside of the routine (?,
just quoting the manual), 9 = not all parameters are corrected,
10 = fully checked and corrected), relative.humidity,
wind.speed, temp.min.at.ground, wind.speed.peak, prec.type (0 =
no precipitation, 1 = only rain (before 1979), 2 = unknown, 4 =
only rain (after 1979), 7 = only snow, 8 = snow or rain),
sunshine.duration, snow.height. Default = default.}

\item{download.folder}{Specifies the data will be stored and
downloaded too. It is advised to store it in the path stored in
the options( "climex.path" ),  which is also used for importing
the saved data. You can overwrite its default value of
"~/R/climex/" by adding options( climex.path = "PATH" ) to your
.Rprofile path in your home.}

\description{
Downloads daily weather data from observation
  stations in Germany and extracts minimum and maximum temperature
  as well as precipitation data.
}
\details{
The download will be done using 'wget'. Per default the
  climex.path variable from the getOption( "climex.path" ) will be
  used to set the download path. Since this function will check
  the files already present it's strongly recommended to use the
  save.downloads options. Whenever this function is invoked again
  only updated files will be downloaded which saves a lot of
  traffic and time. The csv.export option can be used to export
  the time series into a data type file making it available
  outside of R too. In addition, the geographic positions of the
  individual stations will be extracted and saved as well. They
  are needed for the leaflet module of the climex shiny
  app. CAUTION: since this procedure takes a while its run in
  parallel on all cores of your machine!
