Title: Automated download and formatting of the data provided by the German weather service (DWD).
Description: The German weather service (DWD) provides a large data base via a FTP server. But since the data is stored in separate compressed archives per station, it is a quite tedious task to download a large set of them, like all daily temperature series throughout Germany, at once. This package tries to give the user a more friendly interface. It let you choose the data set of your choice using a command line interface, which guides you through the folder tree of the FTP server. It will download all content in the selected nodes, and convert the extracted data in a format easily usable within R
